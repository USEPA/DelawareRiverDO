# Atlantic Sturgeon Cohort Model

# Overview

This repository includes code, raw data, and outputs resulting from running the code, that were used by EPA to develop the proposed rule *Water Quality Standards to Protect Aquatic Life in the Delaware River* (December 2023).  The code implements models and other analyses to quantify the effects of dissolved oxygen, salinity, and water temperature on juvenile Atlantic sturgeon in zones 3, 4, and upper 5 of the Delaware River.

The Atlantic sturgeon is sensitive to low dissolved oxygen and high water temperature, particularly in its larval and juvenile stages. Several distinct population segments of Atlantic sturgeon were listed as endangered in 2012 under the Endangered Species Act.  The Delaware River, which at one time supported an abundance population of Atlantic Sturgeon, has historically been severely impacted by pollution.  Reductions in pollutant loading since 1970 have resulted in steady water quality improvement in the river.  In 2022, EPA determined that further water quality improvements needed to restore propagation of Atlantic sturgeon in the Delaware River were attainable.

This project implements existing bioenergetics and juvenile cohort models (Niklitschek and Secor 2005, Niklitschek and Secor 2009) to predict the effect on juvenile Atlantic sturgeon of oxygen and water temperature conditions that occur in the Delaware River or are expected to occur in the Delaware River after additional pollutant load reductions are implemented (Delaware River Basin Commission 2022). The analysis quantifies a habitat suitability index (HSI) based on the response of juvenile Atlantic Sturgeon to salinity, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen and uses it to derive threshold values for dissolved oxygen that are expected to support use of the designated zones of the river for propagation by Atlantic Sturgeon and other oxygen sensitive species.

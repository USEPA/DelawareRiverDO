# Atlantic Sturgeon Cohort Model

## Atlantic Sturgeon Cohort Model

## Overview
This repository includes code, raw data, and outputs resulting from running the code, that were created and shared by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), Office of Research and Development, Center for Environmental Measurement and Modeling. These code and associated files were used by the US EPA to develop the final rule Water Quality Standards to Protect Aquatic Life in the Delaware River (September 2025). The code implements models and other analyses to quantify the effects of dissolved oxygen, salinity, and water temperature on juvenile Atlantic sturgeon in zones 3, 4, and upper 5 of the Delaware River.

This project implements existing bioenergetics and juvenile cohort models (Niklitschek and Secor 2005, Niklitschek and Secor 2009; Hagy 2024) to predict the effect on juvenile Atlantic sturgeon of oxygen and water temperature conditions that occur in the Delaware River or are expected to occur in the Delaware River after additional pollutant load reductions are implemented (Zheng et al. 2024). The analysis quantifies a habitat suitability index (HSI) based on the response of juvenile Atlantic Sturgeon to salinity, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen and uses it to derive threshold values for dissolved oxygen that are expected to support use of the designated zones of the river for propagation by Atlantic Sturgeon and other oxygen sensitive species. Additional technical information is available at https://www.epa.gov/wqs-tech/water-quality-standards-delaware-river.

For questions or requests related to the code, users are encouraged to create a github "issue." E-mail inquiries may also be sent to James Hagy at the address below.

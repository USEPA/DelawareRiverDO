# Atlantic Sturgeon Cohort Model

# Overview

This repository houses data and computer code related to simulation modeling and other analyses related to understanding the effects of dissolved oxygen and water temperature on Atlantic sturgeon in the Delaware River. The research supports policy development by US EPA related to dissolved oxygen criteria in the Zones 3, 4 and upper 5 of the Delaware River.

The Atlantic sturgeon is sensitive to low dissolved oxygen and high water temperature, particularly in its larval and juvenile stages.  Several distinct population segments of Atlantic sturgeon were listed as endangered in 2012 under the Endangered Species Act.  The Delaware River has historically been severely impacted by pollution, especially from industrial and municipal wastewater discharges.  Reductions in pollutant loading since 1970 has resulted in stead improvements in water quality in the river.  In 2022, EPA determined that water quality improvements needed to restore propagation of Atlantic sturgeon in the Delaware River were attainable.

This project is implementing a fish bioenergetics model developed for juvenile Atlantic sturgeon by Edwin Niklitschek and Dave Secor and published in 2010 and applying it to predict the effect on juvenile Atlantic sturgeon of oxygen and water temperature conditions that occur in the river or are expected to occur in the river after additional pollutant load reductions are implemented. The Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) implemented an EFDC/WASP model to project expected effects of wastewater treatment upgrades on conditions in the river.
